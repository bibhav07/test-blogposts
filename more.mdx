We recommend using **Static Generation** (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.

```ts
const sum = (num1: number, num2: number): number => {
    return num1 + num2
}

console.log(sum(4,8)) //12
```

You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:

- Marketing pages
- Blog posts
- E-commerce product listings
- Help and documentation

You should ask yourself: "Can I pre-render this page **ahead** of a user's request?" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.

As we eagerly anticipate the upcoming Chandrayaan-3 mission, showcasing India's commitment to lunar exploration, let's embark on a journey through the launch vehicles of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). ISRO has achieved remarkable milestones in space exploration and satellite technology, bolstering India's scientific prowess and communication capabilities. In this blog, we will explore ISRO's significant launch vehicles, including the SLV-3, PSLV, GSLV, GSLV Mk III, and the Sounding Rocket Vehicle. These vehicles have played instrumental roles in shaping India's space program, enabling remarkable achievements and pushing the boundaries of exploration and technological advancements.\n\n## Sounding Rocket Vehicle:\n\nISRO's Sounding Rocket Vehicle (SRV) is primarily used for atmospheric research, scientific experiments, and technology demonstration. Sounding rockets are suborbital vehicles designed to carry scientific instruments and experiments into space for a brief period before returning to Earth. They provide valuable data on atmospheric conditions, study microgravity environments, and test new technologies. The SRV has a smaller payload capacity compared to other launch vehicles, typically ranging from a few tens to a few hundred kilograms. ISRO has developed various sounding rockets, including the RH-200, RH-300, and RH-560, powered by solid propellants.\n\n## SLV-3 (Satellite Launch Vehicle-3):\n\nThe SLV-3 was ISRO's first indigenous satellite launch vehicle, operating from 1980 to 1983. It marked a significant milestone, demonstrating India's capability to design and launch its own satellites. With a limited payload capacity of approximately 40 kg to Low Earth Orbit (LEO), SLV-3 successfully launched the Rohini satellite on July 18, 1980, making India the sixth country to achieve this feat.\n\n## PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle):\n\nThe Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) is one of the most reliable and versatile launch vehicles developed by ISRO. First launched in 1993, PSLV has become the workhorse of ISRO's launch fleet. Designed for different orbits, including Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Sun-Synchronous Orbit (SSO), and Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO), PSLV has multiple configurations optimized for specific mission requirements. The standard PSLV can carry payloads from 500 kg to 1,750 kg to LEO, with a stellar track record, including the successful launch of India's Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan) in 2013.\n\n## GSLV (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle):\n\nDeveloped to meet the demand for launching heavier satellites into Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO), the GSLV is a three-stage vehicle using both solid and liquid propulsion. GSLV has two main variants: GSLV Mk I and GSLV Mk II. The Mk I version had a lift-off weight of approximately 414 tons, placing satellites up to 1,500 kg into GTO. The improved Mk II version, with a higher lift-off weight of around 418 tons, can carry payloads up to 2,500 kg to GTO.\n\n## GSLV Mk III (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III):\n\nOften referred to as the \"Bahubali,\" GSLV Mk III is ISRO's most powerful launch vehicle. Developed for ambitious missions like Chandrayaan-2 and the Gaganyaan program (India's manned space mission), it has a lift-off weight of approximately 640 tons and can deliver payloads up to 10,000 kg to GTO. Its successful debut in 2017 marked a significant milestone, showcasing India's ability to launch heavy satellites and positioning the country among elite space-faring nations.\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nISRO's launch vehicles, from the early successes of SLV-3 and PSLV to the advanced capabilities of GSLV and GSLV Mk III, have revolutionized India's space capabilities. Each launch vehicle has pushed the boundaries of space exploration and communication capabilities. The Sounding Rocket Vehicle facilitates critical atmospheric research and scientific experiments. Together, these launch vehicles have propelled India's scientific progress, strengthened communication networks, and advanced our understanding of space. ISRO's commitment to innovation and excellence continues to inspire and drive India's space endeavors, positioning the nation as a frontrunner in the global space arena.\n

On the other hand, Static Generation is **not** a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.

In that case, you can use **Server-Side Rendering**. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate data.
